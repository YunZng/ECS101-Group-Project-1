George is a little monkey. He lives in a deep forest. He likes jumping and climbing trees. He is happy every day. But he has a shortcoming. He is curious. 
One day an old man goes by the forest. He carries a lot of straw hats. George sees the man, and the man sees George, too. The man says to himself, "What a lovely monkey! I will catch him. I will take him home." 
The man sits down and thinks over. George sees and also sits down. The man has an idea. He puts a hat on his head, and puts other hats on the ground. Then he pretends to sleep. 
George is curious and looks at the hats. "I will be nice if I put a hat on my head." George thinks. Then he climbs down from the tree, picks up a hat and puts it on. The hat is too big, and covers George's eyes. George can't see. And the man gets up at once, rushes out and catches him quickly. 
Poor George!
