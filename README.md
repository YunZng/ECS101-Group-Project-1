We have two compression table, both with the same long binary length, but differ in short binary length.
We are going to create two branches to test out which compression is more effective. 
The codes we have right now are all commented.
First we created a bunch of lists for future input and output.
Then we used loops to add all the long binary and matched them with the lower and upper case using loops. 
We had two plans, one was to add the binary to a list, and characters to another list. The other plan was to add all the values to one dictionary. 
We are not familiar with the dictionary, but it looks very useful as it is like a zipped version of two lists.
